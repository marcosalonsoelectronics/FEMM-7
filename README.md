Files of video FEMM #7: Steady-State Heat Flow Analysis

Available at: https://youtu.be/1I1mQAT1Kts

This video shows how to do steady-state heat-flow finite element analysis using FEMM. The analysis of a heatsink is used as an example. From the analysis results, the thermal resistance of the heatsink can be calculated.
